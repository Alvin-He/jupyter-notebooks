### Introduction to determinting density using graphical analysis

Density is the relationship between mass and volume, specificially $\frac{mass}{volume}$. The relationship equation is similar to a slope equation, $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. Which means we can set the y-axis of the graph to mass and the x-axis to volume and generate a line whose slope is the density we want to find. However, most data don't line up in a perfect straight line. We can solve that with least-square analysis which generate a line of best fit that we can calculate a slope from.
