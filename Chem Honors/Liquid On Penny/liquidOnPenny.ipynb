If we compare the Average volume of water on a penny with the Average volume of of Isopropyl Alcohol on a penny, we can see that the average volume for water on a penny is significantly larger. The test has shown that a penny a hold relatively more water than Isopropyl Alcohol. \n",

    "This's probably caused by the fact that water have 1 more H-Bond compared to Isopropyl Alcohol. Water and Isopropyl Alcohol are both polar compounds as their molecular structures doesn't cancel out their dipole moments. Due to their polarity, both of the compounds allowed for the existence of H-Bond IMF, however, Water have 2 of them; while Isopropyl alcohol only have 1. Meaning that water molecules can stick to other molecules better, which contributed to the penny holding more water than isopropyl alcohol. "
