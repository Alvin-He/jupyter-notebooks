    "1. describe the relationship between the final temperature as a function of the specific heat of a metal\n",
    "   - The final temperature forms an deceasing function with the specific heat of a metal in this system. As the final temperature increases, the $\\Delta T$ of water gets bigger, while the $\\Delta T$ of the metal gets smaller. As we are focusing on the specific heat of the metal, that means that the specific heat of the metal has to decrease, in order to equalize the equation. Meaning that as the final temperature increases, the specific heat of the metal decreases, forming an decreasing relationship.\n",
