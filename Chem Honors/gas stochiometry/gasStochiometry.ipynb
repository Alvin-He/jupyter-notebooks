    "The results of the previous experiment had a high error rate is probably due to calculation drifts and the tiny scale of the mass of Mg also enlarged the error. The result is very close to the actual amount that was put in if you look at it numerically, there's only a 0.005 deviation from the measured result. However, due to the nature of the small numbers, the % error became very high. "
